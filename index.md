### Machine Learning / Computational Data Analytics


- [Compressive Sensing](Compressive_Sensing.pdf)

  Some may have experienced CT Scan (Computed Tomography Scan) machine at the doctor's office. Do you know it is a Machine Learning application?

- [Stock Market Prediction](stock_market_prediction.pdf)

  Stock Market Prediction is probably one of most popular first exercises in the quest of Machine Learning. This exercise is only to explore the basic price movement.

- [Decision Tree vs Random Forest](Email_Spam.pdf)

  Comparison between Decision Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) model process and performance. Random Forest has considerably less steps, but not easy to understand how the internal emsemble technique works.
  
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Visualization](PCA_visualization.pdf)

  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a critical data transformation algorithm. This exercise will illustrate its application in data visualization. Learning data transformation techniques is definitely a light bulb moment personally.

- [Pi Estimation](pi_estimation.pdf)

  This simple yet powerful exercise demonstrated random number's application.
